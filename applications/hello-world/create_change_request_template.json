  "description": "Possible Impact to Japan if unexpected issues arise? NO \n\nProvide a Description of the change and Justification for the change proceeding: \nWe want to upgrade the SellIT-UI application which is an InComm application under the Fusion-SellIT application platform to version NEW_VERSION from its current version CURRENT_VERSION. \n\nSellIT is a portal for Corporate and Store managers to perform their functions by providing a store-level perspective of sales, products, planograms, orders, and inventory. Also, SellIT data is available to the remaining platforms on Fusion. At the launch, SellIT is supporting Albertsons, and in the future, we can onboard more merchants to it.\nAll changes going as part of this release are documented here - RELEASE_NOTES_URL \n\nThe changes have been extensively tested in QA & UAT environments. The approvals have been attached to the change. \nQA Approval - QA_SIGN_OFF_URL \nUAT Approval - UAT_SIGN_OFF_URL \nAutomated regression tests have been run successfully and the results are available here REGRESSION_TEST_SUMMARY_URL \n\nProvide Business impact if this change is not completed: \nIf this change is not completed or delayed, then we would not be able to add more features/fixes to the SellIT Platform as SellIT-UI is an essential part of the Fusion-SellIT platform. Our external customers and internal users will be unable to use the latest upgrades to the platform. \n\nWhat is changing: \nUpgrading SellIT-UI application from version CURRENT_VERSION to NEW_VERSION \n\nWhy is it changing: \nAdd more features/fixes to the SellIT Platform \n\nHow is it changing: \nWe are deploying the latest QA & UAT-approved artifact in Production. We will be using a Github Action as defined at this URL \"https://github.com/InComm-Software-Development/ProduceIT-DevOps/actions/workflows/sellit-prod-deploy.yml\" to deploy the SellIT-UI artifact. The deployer will put in the SellIT-UI artifact version NEW_VERSION in the Github Action workflow UI and click \"Run workflow\" to trigger the deployment process. The GitHub Action will deploy the SellIT-UI application and will run smoke tests to validate if the deployment is successful. Manual validation will also be done during the deployment window.\n",
